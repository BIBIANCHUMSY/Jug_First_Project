# JUG First Java Assignment

This project is a simple Maven-based Java application created as part of my Java upskilling practice.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates:
- Proper Maven project setup
- Basic package and class structure
- Use of the `main()` method as the entry point
- Interaction between multiple classes
- Simple console output and loop execution

## Project Structure
## Description
- `Main.java` contains the `main()` method where the program execution starts.
- `GreetingService.java` contains a method responsible for printing a greeting message.
- The `Main` class creates an instance of `GreetingService` and calls its method.
